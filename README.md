# Intelligent LLM Router

A sophisticated routing engine for Large Language Models (LLMs) designed to automatically direct user prompts to the optimal model provider based on cost, latency, and accuracy requirements. Built with modern web technologies and enterprise-grade architecture patterns.

## Overview

This project provides an intelligent abstraction layer over multiple LLM providers, enabling dynamic model selection based on configurable routing rules. The system analyzes incoming prompts and routes them to the most appropriate LLM provider, optimizing for performance and cost-efficiency.

## Current Status

**In Active Development** - Core infrastructure and foundational architecture complete. Currently implementing routing logic and provider integrations.

### Completed Features

- Modern Next.js 15 application architecture with App Router
- TypeScript-first development with strict type safety
- Server Actions for secure backend operations
- Custom structured logging system with context-aware formatting
- Production-ready UI component library (Radix UI + Tailwind CSS)
- Form handling with React Hook Form + Zod validation
- Environment configuration management
- Development tooling (ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript)

### Planned Features

- **Smart Prompt Routing**: Multi-model classification system to route prompts based on complexity, type, and requirements
- **Provider Integrations**: Support for OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq, Cohere, and Gemini APIs
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Real-time metrics for cost tracking, latency monitoring, and usage statistics
- **Custom Routing Rules**: User-configurable policies for model selection based on speed, cost, or quality
- **A/B Testing Framework**: Compare model performance across different providers
- **Caching Layer**: Intelligent response caching to reduce API costs

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, Radix UI components
- **State Management**: React Server Components, Server Actions
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form, Zod validation
- **Development**: ESLint, Prettier, Turbopack
- **Deployment**: Vercel-ready (optimized for serverless)

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/intelligent-llm-router.git
cd intelligent-llm-router

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env.local
# Add your API keys for LLM providers

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

## Development

```bash
# Run development server with Turbopack
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start

# Lint code
npm run lint

# Format code
npm run format
```

## Architecture Highlights

### Server-Side Logging
Custom `Logger` class with environment-aware output, structured logging, and color-coded terminal display for development debugging.

### Type-Safe Server Actions
All data mutations handled through Next.js Server Actions with full TypeScript support, ensuring type safety from client to server.

### Component Architecture
Modular, reusable components built on Radix UI primitives with consistent styling through Tailwind CSS and class-variance-authority.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Implement prompt classification system
- [ ] Integrate OpenAI API
- [ ] Integrate Anthropic Claude API
- [ ] Build routing decision engine
- [ ] Create analytics dashboard
- [ ] Add response caching layer
- [ ] Implement cost tracking
- [ ] Build A/B testing framework
- [ ] Add rate limiting and queue management
- [ ] Deploy to production

## Use Cases

- **Cost Optimization**: Route simple queries to cheaper models, complex tasks to premium models
- **Latency Optimization**: Send time-sensitive requests to fastest providers
- **Quality Assurance**: Route critical prompts to highest-quality models
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute requests across multiple providers
- **Fallback Handling**: Automatic failover to backup providers
