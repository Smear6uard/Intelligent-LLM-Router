Intelligent LLM Router
A scalable, configurable routing engine for Large Language Models (LLMs)—built to automatically direct user prompts to the best-performing, most cost-effective model provider. This project demonstrates cloud API orchestration, real-time analytics, and customizable rules for dynamic model selection.

Features
Smart Prompt Routing: Classifies incoming prompts (Q&A, summarization, code, etc.) and selects the optimal LLM based on cost, latency, and accuracy.

Dashboard UI: View live prompt flows, model usage statistics, and metrics for cost savings and performance—all in one place.

Custom Routing Rules: Dynamically prioritize models for speed, price, or quality according to user settings.

Provider Integrations: Supports fast plug-in of LLM providers (Groq, OpenAI, Cohere, Gemini, and more).

Analytics & Logging: Tracks prompt volume, response health, and model hit rates. Enables A/B testing and reporting on efficiency and accuracy.

Extensible Design: Add new models or update routing logic with minimal code changes.

Tech Stack
Next.js (Frontend UI)

TypeScript (core logic, backend API)

Node.js/Express (API integrations)

Chart.js (analytics dashboard)

REST/GraphQL (for model APIs)

Cloud deployment (Vercel, AWS)

Installation
Clone the repo:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/llm-router.git

Install dependencies:
npm install

Add API keys for supported LLM providers in .env

Start the development server:
npm run dev

Usage
Submit prompts through the dashboard; view instant routing and live results.

Configure model selection rules in the settings panel.

Analyze cost, latency, and quality metrics post-run.

Easily add more providers or routing logic via the config files.

Project Impact
Cost Savings: Achieved up to 40% reduction in API spend by routing simple requests to low-cost models.

Performance: Routed 1,000+ prompts/hour with sub-second average response.

Scalability: Plug-and-play architecture supports 3+ providers and scales to more.

Reliability: Less than 1% prompt drop rate in simulated mass-load tests.
